didn't completely finish assignment because I didn't give myself enough time :(

Wanted to setup the project to be run anywhere with docker since before it was only able to run on school server with the environment. only few tweaks were made to move it from running on school server to docker. Those changes are def not what I want to keep so those will be changing very soon.

how to run program
- docker-compose up

photos of program running

todo list of stuff I wanna improve
- add file structure we weren't allowed to in assignment
- we used jquery but I wanna use something newer
- finish the assignment with rotations and stuff
- explain what assignment can do and add some sdf files for people to try
